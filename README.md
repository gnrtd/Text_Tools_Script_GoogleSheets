# 🔧 Small Automation, Big Productivity Boost to Google Sheets

Today I added a tiny custom menu in Google Sheets — **Text Tools** — that converts any selected text to **UPPERCASE**, **lowercase**, or **Proper Case** with one click.

No formulas.  
No extensions.  
Just clean, instant formatting ⚡

Dedicated to everyone who works with databases and cleans messy text every day 🤝

Adds a custom menu on top of your Google Sheet:

**Text Tools**

Select any range → click the command → your text is instantly formatted.
